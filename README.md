# Analysing Gender Composition of Candidates in Indian Elections
[PROJECT IN PROGRESS]

This is a personal project where I am wworking with the Bhavnani Open source data on Indian elections since 1977 to 2015. The dataset can be found here: (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/26526)

Right now, I have looked at the average growth (or rather lack of it) in gender ratio of candidates standing up for elections across India.
