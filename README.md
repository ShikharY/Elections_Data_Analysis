# Analysing Gender Composition of Candidates in Indian Elections [**IN PROGRESS**]


This is a personal project where I am wworking with the Bhavnani Open source data on Indian elections since 1977 to 2015. The dataset can be found here: (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/26526)

Right now, I have looked at the average growth (or rather lack of it) in gender ratio of candidates standing up for elections across India.

I have also created a prototype Shiny App which allows users to interact with the dataset.It can be found here: ![Election App](https://shikh-ar.shinyapps.io/Election_App/?_ga=2.229721756.1449603481.1595705999-2037688895.1594230779)
